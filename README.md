#### Hardware and Software wallets that provide features that make Seed XOR easier:

The main benefits of using a hardware or software wallet to manage the seed XOR work for you are:
- saving time.
- accurate handling of the "last word" problem.

However, keep in mind that with convenience, you rely on these manufacturers to be honest, and on the devices you obtain to be uncompromised.

- ColdCard <https://seedxor.com/>
    - Allows splitting and combining on device.
    - [WIP] Allows keeping one part on an SD Card to be combined when signing <https://github.com/Coldcard/firmware/pull/94>
